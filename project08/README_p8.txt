GOAL:  The program confirms that data from a (relatively wide) log-normal distribution follows Benford's Law.

ANSWER to questions:
- What conclusions can you draw?
  The last two conditions where we didn't use mutex ran the faster compared
  to other 4 conditions. This makes sense as for the other 4 conditions,
  mutex have to be locked and unlocked whenever it is overwritten and that takes time.
  Part c and d took longer than other conditions because mutex had to be locked and unlocked
  twice (when updating local and global count) for every count. 
- What can you say about the roles of mutex locks for this problem?
  Mutex locks so that other thread cannot access the same resources at the same time.
  For this problem, mutex locks the counts array before its overwritten and unlocks after
  its overwritten so that no two threads can access to it at the same time.
- In what conditions would you want to use a mutex?
  When you have a resource that don't want two different threads to access at the same 
  time.

< Task 02>
ROOT: project08/
|__/C/
|  |__/imageMul (EXTENSION)
|  |__|__/..
NOTE: This program contains two command-line arguments input to run. (EXTENSION: created three different color filters.)
GOAL: The program reads an image and applies a pixel-wise operator to it. Use parallelism to reduce the computation time.
TO COMPILE $ gcc -o colorize -I. colorize.c ppmIO.c -lm my_timing.c
TO RUN (with command line argument) $ ./colorize <image filename> <filter(bw/bold/neg)> (example: $ ./colorize IMG_4203.ppm bw)
OUTPUT (integrated):
  Serial:
  trial 1: 0.047768 seconds
  trial 2: 0.053045 seconds
  trial 3: 0.053951 seconds
  Average: 0.051588 seconds

  trial 1: 0.046420 seconds
  trial 2: 0.044510 seconds
  trial 3: 0.044595 seconds
  Average: 0.045175 seconds

  2 threads:
  trial 1: 0.029545 seconds
  trial 2: 0.033429 seconds
  trial 3: 0.030901 seconds
  Average: 0.031291 seconds

  4 threads:
  trial 1: 0.027940 seconds
  trial 2: 0.029141 seconds
  trial 3: 0.027864 seconds
  Average: 0.028315 seconds

ANSWER to questions:
- Compare computation times for the serial and parallel versions.
  According to my results, serial version took more time than parallel versions.
- Compare how computation time depends upon the number of threads.
  As seen from the results above, as the number of threads increase, the computation
  time decreases but the time does not decrease at the same ratio as the increase
  in thread.
