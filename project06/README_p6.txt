NOTE: For all operations please locate into ./project06/signalhandler using the "cd" command.
GOAL: This compilation of programs creates examples of signal handling in C.
TO COMPILE $ gcc -o shtest (file)
TO RUN (with command line argument) $ ./shtest
a. interrupt.c: A C program that can be interrupted with `CTRL+C` on the keyboard. 
OUTPUT << miaoyi@Hermes
(ONCE user press CTRL+C) Caught Interrupt signal. Program interrupted.
b. floatingpointexception.c: Generates and handles a floating point exception in C.
OUTPUT << miaoyi@Hermes
Heading to divide by zero... If we got here, it means the program continued after the floating point error occurred.
c. segfault.c: Generates and handles a segmentation fault in C.
OUTPUT << miaoyi@Hermes
Heading to create some undefined behavior... Caught Segmentation Fault signal. Exiting...
