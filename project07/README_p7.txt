< Task 01>
ROOT: project07/
|__/C/
|  |__/timepercall.c
|  |__/tpc_output.csv
GOAL: The program explores the time that it takes (on average) to allocate a certain amount of memory.
TO COMPILE $ gcc -o test timepercall.c
TO RUN (with command line argument) $ ./test
OUTPUT << miaoyi@Hermes
(A well-oriented table, please check "tpc_output.csv" under the same folder for output I saved.)
ANSWER to question:
(EXTENSION: additional graphs.)(Under the same folder generated "tpc_1.png" graph using output.) Using the graph, we see the relationship between the time of a "malloc()" call takes and the number of bytes for that call is in a positive linear relationship. I estimate "malloc()" is around O(n) or O(log n) based on the shape.

< Task 02>
ROOT: project07/
|__/C/
|  |__/numberoftimes.c (EXTENSION: command-line argument enabled.)
|  |__/not_output.csv
NOTE: This program contains a command-line argument input to run.
GOAL: The program explores the time that it takes (on average) to allocate a certain amount of memory over time to see if the time of a memory management call changes with the number of allocation and free operations the program has executed.
TO COMPILE $ gcc -o test numberoftimes.c
TO RUN (with command line argument) $ ./test (integer: input size)
a. interrupt.c: A C program that can be interrupted with `CTRL+C` on the keyboard. 
OUTPUT << miaoyi@Hermes
(A well-oriented table, please check "not_output.csv" under the same folder for output I saved.)
ANSWER to question:
(EXTENSION: additional graphs.)(Under the same folder generated "not_10000.png" and "not_10000000.png" graph using output, showing time for 10000 and 10000000 calls to "malloc()" and "free()" to complete in seconds versus the number of previous calls that the program has made.) Using the graph, we could see the more calls the program has already made, the less costly a new call is. In addition, this relationship seems effected by the input size, and it looks like an inverse logarithmic correlation.
